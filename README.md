# Capstone-Project
This is my Capstone Project for Xander Talent. I used AWS Lambda to create three functions. One for an API involving a website with data on crimes. Another for information on planning. And also an API from a website that provides postcode and consituency information. I utilised these functions to try to extract consituency information using a postcode, nearest postcodes to a given longitude and latitude, and crime information from the police API. Once I had extracted that information, I then tried to connect the lambda functions to my database in MySQLWorkbench using a Python function. I then created four tables on MySQLWorkbench for all 4 API calls that I made: one for the postcodes and constituency information from the first API, one for the crime data, one for the planning information, and another for the nearest postcodes to the longitude and latitude. I then tried to utilise the lambda functions to connect the information from all 4 API calls to my database.
